# AVO-HR: Active Viewpoint Optimization for Human Reconstruction

AVO-HR is a framework for **active viewpoint prediction** under **partial visibility**, designed to improve 3D human reconstruction by choosing the next best camera pose. It integrates 2D–3D reasoning via **mesh–point-cloud alignment** and a **visibility/occlusion-aware** scoring function to rank candidate views.

Code is coming soon.
