# ASVO: Autonomous Sensor View Optimization for Robotic Casualty Assessment

ASVO is a framework for **active viewpoint optimization** under **partial visibility**, designed to improve 3D human reconstruction by choosing the next best camera pose. It integrates 2D–3D reasoning via **mesh–point-cloud alignment** and a **visibility/occlusion-aware** scoring function to rank candidate views.

Code is coming soon.
